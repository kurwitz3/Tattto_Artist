DESCRIPTION-
This is my project on Tattoo Artist. The project basically allows tattto artist to keep 
track of thier clients and the current tattoos they are working on. If you don't have an
account,you just do a quick sign up. Once logged in you will be directed to your personal 
artist page where a list of your current clients will be listed. From this page you will be 
able to view each client, update the client, or delete the client.

INSTRUCTIONS- 
In this project I used Ruby, ActiveRecord, and Sinatra .I used a Sqlite3 database. I also used Shotgun and thin 
for easy editing in the server. Dending on which ActiveRecord you have downloaded on your machine you may need to 
update the  version of ActiveRecord in the Gemfile. Currently I have 5.2 but you may need to change this. Once your 
gems are ready run bundle install. After bundle run shotgun in your terminal it will active your server. Copy and paste
the local host in to your browser and the program will begin.
